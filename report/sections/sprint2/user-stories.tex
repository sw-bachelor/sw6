\section{User stories}
Due to the migration from Xamarin to Flutter, a series of new user stories had to be created, in order to assure that all the functionality from the original application was re-created in the new one.
This lead to the creation of 29 new user stories.
Unlike in sprint 1, where we only provided the teams with the user story, a short description and prototypes to show how the task should be done, we added technical specifications to the user stories, to give the development teams a better understanding of what was expected of them to implement to make the transition to flutter smoother.
An example of this can be seen in the user story ``\texttt{As a guardian I would like to be able to view a given citizens week plan so that I can get an overview of what is happening this week for them}``, which has an associated prototype and the following technical specification:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Make the BLoC needed (Reuse as much as possible)
    \item Make the UI reactive (i.e. show the relevant data)
    \item Make sure the UI upholds the settings set for the user (color, and so on)
\end{itemize}
These technical descriptions were, as mentioned above, created in collaboration with the group SW611F19.

\noindent in this sprint, 16 of the 29 user stories were assigned to groups and these user stories can be seen on \autoref{table:user-stories-sprint-2}

\noindent 
As some of these issues naturally blocked each other due to dependencies, some additional user stories were created in the wiki repository. 
These user stories were primarily meant for the server skill group, and were related to updating the server structure and documenting this process for future students on the GIRAF project to read.
Additionally, as the developers began to get a better understanding of the application and flutter, they began reporting feature requests and bug reports on GitHub, which we continuously evaluated and converted to user stories with a priority related to how essential they were for the application.
