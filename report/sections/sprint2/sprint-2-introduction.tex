\chapter{Sprint 2}
This chapter presents the work done in the second sprint.
Like the first sprint, this sprint started out with us presenting the goals and visions for the project, both in terms of this sprint and for the whole semester.
Due to the atypical structure of sprint 1 because of the change of framework, some groups had some ongoing issues that they did not finish in time for sprint 2 to start, which they now had to complete.
For the groups who were ready for new user stories, they should choose a high priority user story and start working on that.
\\\\
In this sprint, we had three focuses: The creation of new prototypes, presenting them for the customers and working on some development user stories like the development groups.
However, the usability test of the new prototypes and application did not work out this sprint, due to cancellations by the customers. 
\\\\
Finally, a sprint retrospective was held like in the first sprint to share experiences between the groups.
