\chapter{Sprint 2}
This chapter presents the work done in the second sprint.
Like the first sprint, this sprint started out with us presenting the goals and visions for the project, both in terms of this sprint and for the whole semester.
Due to the atypical structure of sprint 1 because of the change of framework, some groups had some ongoing user stories that they did not finish in the first sprint and therefore had to continue working on in sprint 2.
The groups that were ready for new user stories chose a high or highest priority user story and started working on that.
\\\\
This chapter details the user stories that were part of the sprint, as well as new or revised prototypes we constructed.
This was the first sprint in which we were assigned user stories, and how we chose to implement these will be explained.
In order to explain the implementation properly, we also give a short introduction to Flutter and how we use it for the GIRAF application.
We intended to conduct a usability test to test the functionality and design of the application once the sprint had ended.
However, the usability test of the new prototypes and application did not work out due to cancellations by the customers. 
Finally, we detail the release itself as well as the sprint review and retrospective.
