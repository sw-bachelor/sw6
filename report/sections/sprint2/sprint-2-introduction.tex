\chapter{Sprint 2}
Like the first sprint, we presented the goals and visions for the project, both in terms of this sprint and for the whole semester.
Due to the atypical structure of sprint 1, some groups had unfinished user stories they had to continue working on in sprint 2.
The groups that were ready for new user stories chose a high or highest priority user story to implement.
\\\\
This chapter details the user stories that were part of the sprint, as well as new or revised prototypes we constructed.
How we chose to implement our user stories will be explained.
In order to explain the implementation properly, we also give a short introduction to Flutter and how we use it for the GIRAF application.
We intended to conduct a usability test to test the functionality and design of the application once the sprint had ended.
However, the usability test did not work out due to cancellations by the customers. 
Finally, we detail the release itself as well as the sprint review and retrospective.
