\chapter{Sprint 2}
This chapter presents the work done in the second sprint.
Like the first sprint, this sprint started out with us presenting the goals and visions for the project, both in terms of this sprint and for the whole semester.
Due to the atypical structure of sprint 1 because of the change of framework, some groups had some ongoing user stories that they did not finish in the first sprint and therefore had to continue working on in sprint 2.
The groups that were ready for new user stories chose a high or highest priority user story and started working on that.
\\\\
In this sprint, we had three areas of focus:
\begin{itemize}
\item The creation of new prototypes
\item Presenting these new prototypes for the customers
\item Working on some development user stories like the development groups
\end{itemize}
We also intended to conduct a usability test to test the functionality and design of the application once the sprint had ended.
However, the usability test of the new prototypes and application did not work out this sprint due to cancellations by the customers. 
\\\\
Finally, a sprint retrospective was held, just like in the first sprint, to share experiences between the groups.
