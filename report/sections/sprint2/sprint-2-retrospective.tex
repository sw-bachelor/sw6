\section{Sprint retrospective}\label{sec:sprint-2-retrospective}
The sprint retrospective for sprint 2 followed the same procedure as the one for sprint 1, detailed in \autoref{sprint-1-retrospective}
Like in the first sprint, multiple ideas were formulated by the GIRAF teams, two of which related to our role.
One suggestion was that pull requests should always contain a picture showing the graphical result of the changes, as it would make code reviews more effective.

In sprint 2, we would compile the application to examine the graphical changes made by the different groups to ensure they adhered to the prototypes.
This could take unnecessarily long, so adding pictures to the pull request would aid us in performing these checks.

The second suggestion was that a member of our group would always be assigned to pull requests on the weekplanner repository, so that we could see the design and ensure that it followed the prototypes and seemed intuitive for the customers.

\subsubsection{A retrospective for our process}
We experienced that it was hard for us to keep track of exactly what the groups were working on, as some of them would approach us with requests to fix minor bugs that were not reported as issues on GitHub.
To fix this, we used a whiteboard in the group room to document what each group was working on, with a system where we would circle the issue as soon as it entered the review process, and then remove it from the board when it got through the review.
This helped us a lot with seeing if a group was falling behind with their work, and might need some assistance.
Likewise, we could see if a group were just waiting for their work to go through a review, and could start a new user story.
