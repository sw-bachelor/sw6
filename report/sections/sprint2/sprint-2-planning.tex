\section{Sprint introduction}
Sprint 2 began on the 18th of March, and lasted until the 8th of April.
The sprint planning for sprint 2 differed from the previous one.
Based on feedback from the development groups, the process group had decided that this meeting should primarily function as an introduction where the goals of the sprint and user stories should be presented by us.

\subsection{The goals and visions for the GIRAF project}
With the recent switch of framework for front end development, we were left with a application that had less functionality than when we started the previous sprint.
As a result of this, we decided on the following goals:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Achieve a foundation of functionality to make the application usable again
    \item Improve the GUI in the week planner as specified through the prototypes in accordance with the new framework, Flutter.
\end{itemize}
User story selection would differ from the method used during the first sprint, as it was not carried out during the actual planning meeting.
As this meeting was mainly supposed to be an introduction, different teams were allowed to pick an open, highly prioritized user story after discussing them once the meeting had concluded.
This meant that we did not have to send a representative to each group during planning, but the different groups should approach us for discussion and confirmation of user stories when ready.
However, as long as a group had an unfinished user story, this should be their focus.
This meant that the following user stories relating to basic functionality of the week planner were carried into sprint 2:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Login functionality
    \item Week plan view
    \item Navigation
    \item Search pictograms
\end{itemize}
When a group finished implementing their user story during the sprint, they should discuss whether they had time to implement a new user story before the sprint ended. They should then present their next chosen user story to us and get a confirmation before proceeding.

\subsubsection{Our internal goals}
The primary goal for our group this sprint was to keep working on prototypes and implement the user stories assigned to our group.
The two user stories were Weekplanner\#44 and Weekplanner\#43 which were:
\begin{itemize}
 \item "As a citizen I would like to be able to view my week plan so that I know what is going to happen" 
 \item "As a guardian I would like to be able to view a given citizen's week plan so that I can get an overview of what is happening this week for them"
\end{itemize}
We also needed to prepare a release for sprint 2, where we decided which user stories should be included, based on whether or not they adequately fulfilled their requirements and how well they worked with the rest of the system.
There should also be conducted a usability test with the customers to assure that the release actually functions as intended.
Finally, we had to make preparations for sprint 3 which included preparing user stories, prioritizing them and making sure that the prototypes were up to date.
