\section{Sprint planning for sprint 2}
Sprint 2 began on the 18th of March, and stretched until the 8th of April.
As with the first sprint planning conducted for the GIRAF project described in \autoref{sprint-1-planning}, all participating teams gathered to get an understanding of what would happen in the sprint.
This sprint planning differed quiet a bit, however.
Because of suggestions from the developers, the process group had decided that this meeting should primarily function as an introduction where the goals of the sprint and user stories should be presented.

\subsection{The goals and visions of sprint 2}
Based on the recent switch of framework for frontend development, we were left with a system that had less functionality than when we started the previous sprint.
Based on this, the following goals were developed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Achieve a foundation of functionality to make the system usable again
    \item Improve the graphical user interface in the week planner as specified through the prototypes in accordance with the new framework, Flutter.
\end{itemize}
Some development teams were still working on user stories from sprint 1, as there was not enough time left to complete them after the change of framework.
This served as a key point for creation of the sprint backlog.
The most important user stories were those the developers were already working on, but had not completed.

User story selection would differ from the method used during the first sprint, as it was not carried out during the actual planning meeting.
As this meeting was mainly supposed to be an introduction, different teams were allowed to pick an open, highly prioritised user story after discussing them once the meeting had concluded.
This meant that the PO group would not be able to send a representative to each group during planning, but the different groups should approach the PO group for discussion and confirmation of stories when ready.
However, as long as a group had an unfinished story, that story should be the one they focused on.
This meant that the following stories relating to basic functionality of the week planner were carried into sprint 2:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Login functionality
    \item Week plan view
    \item Navigation
    \item Search pictograms
\end{itemize}
When a new story were to be selected, the groups should initially choose one from the following highly prioritised stories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Update status of activities
    \item Swap between citizen and guardian mode and prompt the user for a password when needed
    \item Reorganizing the order of activities
    \item Show details of an activity
\end{itemize}
When a group finishes implementing their user story during the sprint, they should discuss if they have time to implement a new user story before the sprint is ended. They should then present their chosen user story to the PO group and get a confirmation.
