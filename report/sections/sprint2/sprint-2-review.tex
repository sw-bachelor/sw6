\section{Sprint review}


\subsubsection{PO goal review}
Most of our goals this sprint were resolved.
The two user stories were implemented and included in the release. 
We prepared the release as detailed in \todo{ref til afsnit om release prep} and got the release ready for the usability test.
However, as explained in \todo{referer til "Usability test in sprint 2"} there were no customers available at the chosen date due to sudden complications.
