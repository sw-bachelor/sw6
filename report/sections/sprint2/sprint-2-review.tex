\noindent
As was the case with sprint 1, as seen in \autoref{sprint-1-review}, a lot of user stories ended up being incomplete.
This was attributed to groups generally overestimating their work capacity, leading to them not having enough time.

\subsubsection{PO goal review}
Most of our goals this sprint were completed.
The two user stories were implemented and included in the release. 
We prepared the release as detailed in \autoref{sprint-2-release} and got the release ready for the usability testing.
However, as explained in \autoref{sprint-2-usability-test} there were no customers available at the chosen date due to sudden complications.
\autoref{PO-goal-sprint-2-review} shows the status of our goals as sprint 2 ended.
