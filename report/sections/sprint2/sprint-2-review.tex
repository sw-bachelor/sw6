\subsubsection{PO goal review}
Most of our goals this sprint were resolved.
The two user stories were implemented and got into the release. 
We prepared the release and got the release ready for the usability test.
However, as explained in \todo{referer til "Usability test in sprint 2"} there were no customers who were available at the chosen date.
