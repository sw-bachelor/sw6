\section{Usability test 9/4}
Unfortunately there were no customers who showed up, and hereby we were unable to perform a usability test.
This gave us some time to reflect on how our contact were with the customers.
\\\\
We sent our first email with dates for all the meetings for the entire semester at the March 19th and a reminder again April 2nd.
In both emails we asked for them to answer if they were able to show up. 
Only two customers answered our email. 
One customer answered at March 21st that they was able available at all dates, but had to cancel April 8th because of personal issues.
The second customer answered April 8th that they were unable to show up.
\\\\
There were still 4 customers that were invited, but didn't answer.
This has also happend to a PO group previous year, where they assumed that no one showed up, but this time a customer showed up on Cassiopeia and the PO group were not even on the university at that time. 
As we had gotten no answered we prepared for the usability test and assumed that at least one would show up to avoid the same situation.
\\\\
This episode caused us to reflect more on how we handle these invitations.
We will for the next usability test still send out invitations and reminders through email, but around a week before we strive to call all the customers to get an answer on if they show up. 
\\\\
As this was the first sprint using flutter, it was limited how much functionality there were to test in this release. 
For this reason we choose to not invite for a usability test before May second.
