\section{Usability test 9/4}
Unfortunately no customers were able to show up, and hereby we were unable to perform a usability test.
This gave us some time to reflect on how our contact with the customers and how we could improve.
\\\\
We sent our first email with dates for all the meetings for the entire semester on March 19th and a reminder on April 2nd.
In both emails we asked for them to respond if they were available. 
Only two customers answered our email. 
One customer initially resonded on March 21st saying that they were available at all dates. 
The day before the usability test, however, they had to cancel because of personal issues.
The second customer answered on April 8th that they were unable to show up.
\\\\
There were still 4 customers that were invited, but did not answer.
This has also happend to a PO group in a previous year, where they assumed that no one would show up, but a customer showed up on Cassiopeia and the PO group was not even on the university at that time. 
As we had gotten no answers we prepared for the usability test and assumed that one representative might show up to avoid the same situation.
Unfortunately, no one did.
\\\\
This episode caused us to reflect more on how we handle these invitations.
For the next usability test we will still send out invitations and reminders through email, but around a week before it takes place we will call all the customers to get a definitive answer regarding whether or not they are available. 
\\\\
As this was the first sprint using Flutter, the functionality of the release available to test was limited. 
For this reason we chose to not invite the customers for another usability test before May 2nd, when the third sprint ends.
This choice was also based on the expectation that the weekplannner would have lots of functionality to test at this time.
