\section{Our process}
In the start of the semester we were discussing how the process should work in our group, we ended up doing it the way we decribed in \autoref{intro:the-process-in-our-group}.
We wanted to use something based off of Scrum because we have used Scrum the last couple of semesters, had a course where one subject was Scrum and because the GIRAF project was going to use some variant of Scrum as decribed in \autoref{the-giraf-process}.
\\\\
One of our first decisions was that our sprints length should only be one week long compared to the two to four weeks of the GIRAF project.
One argument was that it would be easier to keep track if we aligned our sprints with the GIRAF project, but unlike the GIRAF project our sprints was not planned at such an extent that we would have enough tasks in the backlog for a four week sprint.
\\\\
Instead we decided that one week sprints suited us best.
We also had weekly meetings with our supervisor, so being able to schedule the sprint around this worked well.
Our sprints would end the day we had to send our report to her and the next day after the meeting we could add her feedback to the ongoing sprint.
\\\\
We decided to not hold stand up meeting as we are only six people in the group and everyone would meet in our group room everyday.
Therefore there everyone would know how far along each other was with their tasks and if anything was blocked it could quickly be resolved without arranging a extra meeting.
\\\\
Having the product owner role rotate between group members each new sprint also worked out great in our case.
It gave everyone a chance to decide how they wanted our project to proceed and decide the priority of tasks for the sprint.
Also by having everyone being capable of adding new tasks everyone always had a say of what should be included in the project and report.
