\section{Our process}
In the start of the semester we were discussing how the process should work in our group, we ended up doing it the way we described in \autoref{intro:the-process-in-our-group}.
We wanted to use something based off of Scrum, as we had used it in the last couple of semesters and because the GIRAF project was going to use the GIRAF version of Scrum as described in \autoref{the-giraf-process}.
\\\\
One of our first decisions was that the length of our sprints should only be one week compared to the sprints of the GIRAF project which were two to four weeks long.
One of the counter arguments was that it would be easier to keep track of them if we aligned our sprints with the GIRAF project, but unlike the GIRAF project our sprints were not planned at such an extent that we could have enough tasks in the backlog for a four week sprint.
\\\\
Instead we decided that one week sprints suited us best.
We also had weekly meetings with our supervisor, therefore scheduling the sprints around this worked well.
Our sprints would end the day we had to send our report to our supervisor and a new sprint would start.
The new sprint always included a task to fix feedback from the supervisor, and that someone had to act as internal product owner.
\\\\
We decided to not have daily stand up meeting, as everyone would meet in our group room everyday and progress would naturally be discussed amongst our group members.
Therefore everyone would know how far along the other group members were with their tasks and if anything was blocked it could quickly be resolved without arranging an extra meeting.
\\\\
The product owner role rotated every week between group member which worked better for our situation. 
It gave everyone a chance to decide how they wanted our project to proceed and decide the priority of tasks for the sprint.
Likewise, allowing everyone to add new tasks, we ensured that everyone had a say in what should be included in the project and report.
