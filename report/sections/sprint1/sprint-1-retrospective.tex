\section{Sprint retrospective}
Immediately after the sprint review had concluded we started the sprint retrospective.
This is a meeting that every member of the GIRAF project should attend, such that everyone can give their opinion on how they thought the processes of the sprint had been conducted.
After everyone had arrived, each group got five minutes to talk about the sprint process and whether there was anything that they felt should be changed, or if there was something they felt worked really well.
\\\\
After this discussion, people were split up into different mixed groups with one representative from each GIRAF group.
These new groups started to discus the processes and talked about the shortcomings of the sprint.
This resulted in each of these new groups coming up with some new ideas of what could be done differently.
When everyone was done discussing, all these new ideas were put up on a website where each person could vote anonymously on the three ideas they liked best.
\\\\
The ideas has been compiled into a list as shown bellow.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Not everyone needs to be at the sprint planning.
    \item Remember to come ask the PO group if in doubt about anything related to the user story.
    \item Less meetings on days without lectures.
    \item Get some of the developers to do technical explanations of the user stories so that there is a customer and a developer perspective on each user story.
    \item More systematic standup meetings. It should be enforced that every group has a representetive present.
    \item Stop having sprint planning meetings.
    \item Use the F-club's facilities as a more relaxed space for discussion. 
    \item Standup meetings shouldn't be placed in the middle of Advanced Algorithm exercise sessions.
    \item Acquire new tablets since some of the current ones are in bad condition or are to old to run the newest versions of their operating system.
    \item Consider doing online standup meetings or allow people to attend the meetings virtually.
    \item Less meetings on days with lectures.
    \item Standup meetings shouldn't be right after or before a lecture.
    \item More hack-a-thons.
    \item Consider when the PO group should review functionality. 
    \item The PO group should go around and ask how far the different groups are with their tasks.
    \item More activities across the different groups.
\end{itemize}
Afterwards the sprint retrospective was over.
The process group then took the ideas and started considering how they could incorporate these into the next sprint.
\\\\
The idea that each user story should have an technical explanation was the most voted for idea. 
Following the meeting it was quickly introduced as a new standard for new user stories and existing user stories got a technical explanation added.
Furthermore developing groups was encouraged to come see the PO group more in case of doubt which seemed to have worked.
The process group decided that the sprint planning meeting should be changed to the sprint introduction.
These processes are described in \ref{subsec:SoS-sprint-planning} and \ref{subsec:SoS-sprint-introduction} respectively.
The process group also tried to get iPads and newer tablets but was not successful in accomplishing this.
