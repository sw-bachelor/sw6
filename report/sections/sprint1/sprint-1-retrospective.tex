\section{Sprint retrospective}

Immediately after the sprint review had finished we start the sprint retrospective. 
This is a meeting that every member of the GIRAF project should attend so that everyone can give their opinion on how they thought the processes of the sprint had been.
After everyone had arrived, each group got five minutes to talk about the sprint process and if there were anything that they felt should be changed or if there were something they felt worked really well.

After this discussion people were split up into different group with one representetive from each regular group. 
Then these new groups started to discus the processes and talked about the shortcomings of the sprint. 
This resulted in each  of these new groups making some new ideas of what could be done differently.
When everyone was done discussing all these new ideas was put up on a website where each person could vote anonymously on the three ideas they liked best.

The sprint retrospective meeting was now finished. 
The Scrum-group then took the ideas and started on thinking how they could incorporate these into the next sprint.
