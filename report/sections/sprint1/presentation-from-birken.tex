\section{Presentation from Kindergarden Birken 27/2}
Birken is a kindergarden for children with autism and ADHD.
Kristine and Susanne are the representative from the kindergarden and are the once who conducted the presentation.
The children are from the age of 0 to 7, but usually at least 2 years old.
\\
During the presentation they told a lot about what autism is and how it influences the children with the diagnose of autism.
Children with autism lack communicative skills and stucture. 
One example they gave, was that a child could sit in front of a lunch box for 15 minutes without start eating, because they didn't know how to begin.
Another example was if they had to go to the bathroom, they needed to know the order they have to complete the task.
Birken solved this by having a column of small pictograms, which showed the order they had to follow. 
Hereafter they needed to know the order to wash their hands.
There would be a column of pictograms by the toilet and one by the sink.
\\\\
After talking about what autism and ADHD is, they followed to talk about the visions they have for the weekplanner.
They emphasize strongly that they wanted a stable program and that it should be usable offline.
Children with autism often like predictability and repetitiveness. 
If is not possible to log into the weekplanner because it is either not stable or not connected to the internet, the children would quickly get frustrated.
Therefore a stable and a usable program when being offline was the most important thing for them.

\subsection{Useful features for weekplanner}
Kristine and Susanne also talked about other useful features, that would enhance the usability in the weekplanner.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Be able to take pictures and insert into them the weekplanner
    \item Be able to duplicate a week to other weeks
    \item Be able to make template schedules for the weeks
    \item Be able to change background to other colors to help new children like the kindergarden 
\end{itemize}

Being able to take pictures and inserting them into the weekplanner would enhance the flexibility for the program.
If they suddenly have to change plans the pedagogue should be able to insert a picture if there is not an existing pictogram for the new plans.
\\
Being able to duplicate a week to other weeks and make templates is to save time for the pedagogue. 
It currently already takes them a long time to plan the new weeks for the children. 
If they need to manually insert a pictogram every time for almost identical weeks on different iPads it would be very time consuming for them.
\\
The need to change the background is to accommodate new children arriving in the kindergarden. 
They want to change color to the childs favorite color. 
Hereby the child sees something that it reconizes and likes, and this can give them a better introduction and first impression to the kindergarden.
