\section{Sprint review}

At the end of the sprint we held a meeting called the sprint review, as mentioned in \ref{subsec:SoS-print-}.
Every group had a representetive present, while the PO- and Scrum-group had all their members at the meeting.

As per protocol each group presented the work they had done doing the sprint.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Group 2 were not completely done, they still needed test for their code.
    \item Group 8 ran into a dependency problem as they needed a feature that another group was working on. Therefore they did not finish there user-story.
    \item Group 9 had completed their user-story. Maybe they could do some small design tweaks but the functionality was complete.
    \item Group 10, our group the PO-group, were not finished with the user-stories we were given. Since we are the PO-group we also had other responsibilities which were completed. We had customer interviews and meeting, we created a new design guide, we corrected outdated prototypes and created as well as edited user-stories.
    \item Group 11 were the group responsible for fixing errors people encountered with the new flutter api. Therefor they had done a lot of bug fixing which they were still working on. Their user-story was not completely done as a result of this.
    \item Group 12 had made their user-story. But there seemed to be a problem with the backend implementation. As their user-story was only frontend related it was considered done and a new issue related to the backend was created instead.
    \item Group 13 were also almost done with their user-story.
\end{itemize}

This sprint review was a bit unusual. This was a result of the decision to change the frontend framework which meant that the groups had to start from scratch on new issues and user-stories in the middle of the sprint.
Therefore it was expected that most groups would not have completed their tasks.
