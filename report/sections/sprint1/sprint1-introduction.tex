\chapter{Sprint 1}
This chapter presents the work done in the first sprint.
The sprint kicked off with the sprint planning meeting, where we presented the vision and goal for the sprint to the other groups.
The other groups then chose their user stories to work on for the sprint.
During sprint 1, a presentation was made by Birken and later an interview with Susanne from Birken and Mette from Egebakken was conducted where the prototypes we had made were presented in order to get feedback.

During the first weeks of development many of the groups experienced problems with the frontend framework Xamarin, which led to changing the framework to Flutter.
This meant that we had to recreate the existing frontend from scratch, and therefore we, as PO, had to create a lot of new user stories that covered these features.
The change happened late in the sprint, which meant that the new user stories the groups were working on implementing had to carry over to sprint 2.
\\\\
During sprint 1 we also recreated the existing design guide to be less overwhelming, by making it more concise and making it available on the GIRAF github.
In the end of the sprint a sprint review was held where every group had a representative at the meeting, while all of our group was present. At this meeting, each group presented what work they had finished during the sprint.
Finally, a sprint retrospective was held where all groups were present and process improvements were discussed.
