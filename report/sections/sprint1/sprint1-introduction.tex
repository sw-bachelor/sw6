\chapter{Sprint 1}
This chapter presents the work done in the first sprint.
The sprint started with the sprint planning meeting, where we presented the vision and goal for the sprint to the other groups.
The other groups then chose their user stories to work on for the sprint.
During sprint 1, a presentation was made by Birken and later an interview with Susanne from Birken and Mette from Egebakken was conducted where the prototypes we had made were presented in order to get feedback.
\\\\
During the first weeks of development, many of the groups experienced problems with the front end framework Xamarin, which led to changing the framework to Flutter.
This meant that the development groups had to recreate the existing front end from scratch, and therefore we had to create a series of new user stories that covered these features.
\\\\
During sprint 1 we also recreated the existing design guide.
At the end of the sprint, a sprint review was held where every group had a representative at the meeting, while all of our group was present.
Finally, a sprint retrospective was held where all groups were present and process improvements were discussed.
