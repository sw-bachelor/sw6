\chapter{Sprint 1}
This chapter presents the work done in the first sprint.
The first meeting this semester was the sprint planning meeting, where the vision and goal was presented.
During sprint 1, a presentation was made by Birken and later on, an interview with Susanne from Birken and Mette from Egebakken was conducted where the prototypes were presented in order to get some feedback on them.
