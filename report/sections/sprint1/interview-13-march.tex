\section{Interview with customer representatives 13/3}\label{interview13/3}
During pre-sprint 1 and the beginning of sprint 1 a lot of changes and design updates were considered for the interface of GIRAF.
This resulted in new prototypes, icons and a revision of the previous design guide used for the project.
To evaluate the changes made, we invited customer representatives to come for an interview and a presentation of the changes.
This interview was scheduled to take place on March 13th.
Two representatives from different partners were able to make this meeting - Susanne from Birken and Mette from Egebakken.

\subsection{The interview structure}
The primary goal of the interview was to confirm that the changes made to the design were acceptable. 
The secondary goal was to clarify certain uncertainties we encountered. 
To reach these goals, we structured the interview to consist of a presentation and some prepared questions targeting the areas of uncertainty.
The presentation was based on the most relevant new prototypes, and we encouraged discussions pertaining to the given prototype alongside the presentation.
Specifically, the prototypes had changed and needed feedback on were related to the following functionalities of GIRAF:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The timer functionality
    \item Choosing how to represent time
    \item Pictogram search
    \item Different ways of marking activities as done
    \item Copying a week plan to a different citizen
    \item The redone login screen with citizen selection
    \item Greyscale functionality
    \item Showing different amounts of days
    \item Horizontal view of week plan
    \item Marking multiple activities at the same time
\end{itemize}
