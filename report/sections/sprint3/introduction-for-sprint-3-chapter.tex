This chapter presents the third sprint, which had the same overall structure as sprint 2.
We presented the purpose of the sprint and the user stories that we defined as most important during the sprint introduction.
We were also assigned three user stories throughout the sprint, which we will present the implementation details of in this chapter.
In addition to the user stories, we continued to update and create new prototypes, and prepared a release at the end in conjunction with all the groups on the project.
This sprint was also the first time we were able to conduct a usability test, which was conducted with Emil from Egebakken.
