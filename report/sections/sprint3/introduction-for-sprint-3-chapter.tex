This chapter presents the third sprint.
The overall structure was the same as sprint 2.
We presented the purpose of the sprint and the user stories that we defined as most important during the sprint introduction.
We were also assigned three user stories throughout the sprint.
The way we implemented these will be detailed in the chapter.
We continued to update and create new prototypes, and prepared a release at the end in conjunction with all the groups on the project.
Sprint 3 represented the first time we were able to conduct a usability test. 
This test involved Emil from Egebakken, and how he interacted with the program will be detailed.
