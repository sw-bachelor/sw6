\section{Sprint introduction}
Sprint 3 began on the 9th of April, and stretched until the 29th of April.
As with the previous sprint, the sprint introduction started with a small presentation of the following sprint. 
The presentation also included a presentation of the most important features in the product backlog.
After the presentation the development groups looked through the backlog, and requested to be assigned certain user stories by the PO group.

\subsection{The goals and visions for the GIRAF project}
The goals for the following sprint are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Finish sprint 1 and sprint 2 user stories
    \item Add functionality to remove activities
    \item Implement a way to rearrange pictograms
    \item New font throughout the application
    \item Implementation of guardian and citizen mode
\end{itemize}

\noindent
As for the product vision for the GIRAF project this semester, we decided to removed the plan for offline availability. 
This feature is simply too big to be implemented within the two following sprints, as we also have other more important features to ensure satisfactory functionality.

\subsection{The goals for the PO group}
One of the goals for the PO group is to complete the user stories and bug fixes assigned to our group.
These two user stories are weekplanner\#133, weekplanner\#92 and the bug weekplanner \#125.

\begin{itemize}
    \item "As a guardian I would like to be able to logout when I'm on the choose citizen page so that I can return to the login page"
    \item "As a developer I would like the application to use a default font so that I can easily change it"
    \item "Exception thrown when rendering WeekPlanScreen, issue \#44"
\end{itemize}
\noindent
Besides the two user stories and the bugfix we still need to complete the PO tasks that we have every sprint.
We have a goal to conduct a usability test with the customers to test the application and to get feedback on the design of new prototypes.
Additionally, we need to prepare the release for sprint 3 and prepare sprint 4.
