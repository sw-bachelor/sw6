\section{Sprint introduction}
Sprint 3 began on 9th of April, and stretched until the 29th of April.
As with the previous sprint ...

\subsection{The goals and visions for the GIRAF project}
The goals for the following sprint are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Finish sprint 1 and sprint 2 user stories
    \item Rearrange pictograms
    \item New font
    \item Implementation of guardian and citizen mode
\end{itemize}



\subsection{The goals for the PO group}
One of the goals for the PO group is to complete the user stories and bug fixes assigned to our group.
These two user stories are weekplanner\#133, weekplanner\#92 and the bug weekplanner \#125.

\begin{itemize}
    \item "As a guardian I would like to be able to logout when Im on the choose citizen page so that i can return to the login page"
    \item "As a developer I would like the application to use a default font so that I can easily change it"
    \item "Exception thrown when rendering WeekPlanScreen, issue \#44"
\end{itemize}
\noindent
Beside the two user stories and the bugfix we still need to complete the PO tasks that we have every sprint.
We have a goal to conduct a usability test with the customers to test the application and to get feedback on the design on new prototypes.
Additionally we need to prepare the release for sprint 3 and prepare sprint 4.
