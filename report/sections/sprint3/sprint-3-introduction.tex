\section{Sprint introduction}
Sprint 3 began on the 9th of April, and lasted until the 29th of April.
As with the previous sprint, the sprint introduction started with a small presentation of the upcoming sprint. 
The presentation also included a presentation of the most important features in the product backlog.
After the presentation the development groups looked through the backlog, and requested to be assigned certain user stories by us.

\subsection{The goals and visions for the GIRAF project}
The goals for this sprint were:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Finish sprint 1 and sprint 2 user stories
    \item Add functionality to remove activities
    \item Implement a way to rearrange pictograms
    \item New font throughout the application
    \item Implementation of guardian and citizen mode
\end{itemize}

\noindent
As for the product vision for the GIRAF project this semester, we decided to remove the requirement for offline availability. 
This feature was simply too big to be implemented within the remaining time period.

\subsection{Our internal goals}\label{sprint-3-po-goals}
Our goals included the user stories Weekplanner\#133, Weekplanner\#92 and Weekplanner\#125:

\begin{itemize}\label{item:userstories-sprint-3}
    \item Weekplanner\#133 - "As a guardian I would like to be able to logout when I'm on the choose citizen page so that I can return to the login page"
    \item Weekplanner\#92 - "As a developer I would like the application to use a default font so that I can easily change it"
    \item Weekplanner\#125 - "Exception thrown when rendering WeekPlanScreen, issue \#44"
\end{itemize}
\noindent
Besides the user stories we still needed to complete the PO tasks that we had every sprint.
We had a goal to conduct a usability test with the customers to test the application and to get feedback on the design of new prototypes.
Additionally, we needed to prepare the release for sprint 3 and prepare an introduction for sprint 4.
