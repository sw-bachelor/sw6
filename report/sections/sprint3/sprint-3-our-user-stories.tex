\section{Our assigned user stories}
As described in \autoref{sprint-3-po-goals}, we had the goal of implementing the following three user stories.
\begin{itemize}\label{item:our-stories-sprint-3}
    \item Weekplanner\#133 - "As a guardian I would like to be able to logout when I'm on the choose citizen page so that I can return to the login page"
    \item Weekplanner\#92 - "As a developer I would like the application to use a default font so that I can easily change it"
    \item Weekplanner\#125 - "Exception thrown when rendering WeekPlanScreen, issue \#44"
\end{itemize}
