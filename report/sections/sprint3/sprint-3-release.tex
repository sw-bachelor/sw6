\section{Release 2019S3R1} \label{sec:sprint-3-release} 
When the release preparation started, we expected that every user story in the sprint would be finished and merged into develop by the end of the preparation period. 
The ones that were not ready would not be included in the release.
The user stories that were not completed in time for the release can be seen in \autoref{table:unfinished-user-stories-sprint-3}.

    \begin{tabular}{|p{3.5cm}|p{9cm}|}
    \hline
    Issue ID        & User story   \\ \hline
    Weekplanner\#57  & As a guardian I would like to be able to remove an activity from the week plan so that cancelled activities can be removed from the citizens plan \\ \hline
    Weekplanner\#155 & As a guardian I would like to see the icons of a citizen on the choose citizen screen so that I can quickly identify them \\ \hline
    Weekplanner\#157 & As a user I want to be prompted an error message when failing to login correctly during a change from guardian to citizen \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}

\noindent
For the preparation, all the groups met up and systematically went through each new feature to see if they worked as expected. 
We did this as a result of a suggestion described in \autoref{sec:sprint-2-retrospective}, in order to make communication smoother during release preparation.
Each group reviewed a couple of user stories that they had not developed themselves and checked for bugs or inconsistent design. 
We created a checklist that the groups could use when testing the features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can the screen be reached through navigation in the application?
    \item Can you perform all the functionality defined in the issue?
    \item Can it be used without crashing?
    \item Does it run without bugs?
    \item Does it still look acceptable if you change to a new device or change orientation?
\end{itemize}
Bugs that were found were reported on Github by the groups. 
We then assigned other groups to solve these bugs.
Each pull request still had two code reviewers and a PO reviewer during release. 
We tried to be highly available during the release preparation so that if the groups had any questions regarding design or functionality we would be there to answer them.
\\\\
When the bugs had been fixed, we held a release party where each group had a chance to present the functionality that they had been working on during the sprint.
