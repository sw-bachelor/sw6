\section{Release 2019S3R1}
For the release in this sprint all groups of GIRAF had a release preparation period for the last two days of the sprint. 
When the release preparation started, we expected every user story in the sprint to be finished and merged into develop. 
The ones that were not ready did not get included in the release. The release branch was then created from the develop branch.
The user stories that did not make it in time for the release can be seen in \autoref{table:unfinished-user-stories-sprint-3}.

    Issue ID        & User story   \\ \hline
    Weekplanner \#57  & As a guardian I would like to be able to remove an activity from the week plan so that cancelled activities can be removed from the citizens plan \\ \hline
    Weekplanner \#155 & As a guardian I would like to see the icons of a citizen on the choose citizen screen so that I can quickly identify them \\ \hline
    Weekplanner \#157 & As a user I want to be prompted an error message when failing to login correctly during a change from guardian to citizen \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}

For the preparation, all groups of GIRAF sat together and systematically went through each new feature to see if they worked as expected. We did this as a result of \autoref{sec:sprint-2-retrospective} to make communication a lot smoother during release preparation.
The way it was done was by having each group review a couple of user stories that they had not developed themselves and check for bugs or inconsistent design. 
We created a checklist that the groups could used when testing the features.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can the screen be reached through navigation in the application?
    \item Can you perform all the functionality defined in the issue?
    \item Can it be used without crashing?
    \item Does it run without bugs?
    \item Does it still look acceptable if you change to a new device or change orientation?
\end{itemize}
Bugs were reported on Github by the groups, and we, as the PO group, assigned other groups to solve these bugs.
All groups of GIRAF then sat together and solved the bugs by branching out from the release branch and merging into it again when they had solved the bug. 
We still had two code reviewers and a PO reviewer for each pull request during release. 
If the groups had any questions regarding design or functionality, we as PO group were always available to answer questions which was one of the benefits of having a release preparation together.
\\\\
When all the most critical bugs had been fixed, we held a release party where each group had a chance to present the functionality that they had been working on during the sprint.
