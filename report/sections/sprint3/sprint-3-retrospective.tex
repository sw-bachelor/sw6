\section{Sprint retrospective}
The sprint retrospective was different than it usually was. 
As the first thing all giraf groups shortly debated how the process for the sprint was for each group.
After that everyone split into new groups to discuss it with other people from other groups.
Everything that was discussed was added to a document, and later the process group created a survey to get everyones opinion on every subject.
In the previous retrospectives we used dotstorm, and were only able to vote on 3 things that we agreed on.
This meant that people only would agree upon the most important things, even though there might be smaller less important things that were useful.
\\\\
For each statement or idea there were 3 possible answers which were the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It is a good idea / I agree
    \item I do not care
    \item It is not a good idea / I disagree
\end{itemize}
As a result the process group decided to change the following aspects: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Stand up meetings should focus more on explaining what the different groups user stories are about. The purpose of this is to find dependencies between groups.
    \item If you are assigned a user story that is blocked, then write on GitHub which user story it is blocked by and unassign you from the user story.
    \item One pull request for each user story unless if two user stories overlap
    \item Read through the entire pull request every time you review item
    \item You should aim to review the pull request that you are assigned to on the same day that you get assigned. If that is not possible, then contact the pull request owner.
    \item Be more active on Slack. Look at least once a day
    \item Contact PO if you have nothing to do.
    \item Tell PO if your user story is not able to be completed within the following sprint.
\end{itemize}
