\section{Sprint review}
The sprint review meeting was cancelled during this sprint. 
This was due to it being to similar to the stand up meetings, and therefor it seemed unnecessary. 
We do still evaluate on how many of the user stories are completed and which are incomplete and can do that by seeing the status on GitHub.
Most user stories were completed within the sprint and only 5 user stories being incomplete.    
The user stories for sprint 3 and their status can be seen on \autoref{table:sprint-3-review}
