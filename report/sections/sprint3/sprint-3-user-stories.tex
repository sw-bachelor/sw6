\section{User stories}
The new user stories for this sprint are seen on \autoref{table:user-stories-sprint-3}.
In this sprint there are a lot of tasks that are not new user stories, but either bugs or small refactoring tasks that needs to be completed.
During sprint 2 the PO didn't have to approve every pull request on Github. 
This resulted in some pull requests getting merged without PO approval.
Due to this, there are some refactorings and bug fixes that are prioritized, so that we dont have to fix it much later.
These tasks are Weekplanner\#137, Weekplanner\#138, Weekplanner\#146, Weekplanner\#149, Weekplanner\#157, Weekplanner\#165 and Weekplanner\#166.
