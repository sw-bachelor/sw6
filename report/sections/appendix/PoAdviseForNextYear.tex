\section{PO advise for next the next year PO group} \label{appendix:PO-advise}
This document servers as a list of adivse for the next PO group based on the experience we gathered throughout the semester.
\\
The PO group's main responsiblity is to communicate with the customers of the Giraf project and document this interaction.
It is important that the customers reactions, opinions and wishes, towards the program, are written down as these are the base for all the decisions that you as the PO group will take.

\subsection{Customer contact}
In the start of the semester Ulrik will most likely schedule some meetings with the customers which everyone should attend to get up to speed with what exactly the GIRAF project is and how the program is supposed to help people diagnosed with autism.
Already before these meetings it is a good idea to contact the customers to try and arrange time for a more secluded meeting where you as the PO group can ask more specific questions about how they want the program to function and the design to look.
The other groups should not be present for these meetings as it is your responsiblity to relay this information to the other groups.
We arranged a meeting with Emil from Egebakken right after his presentation. 
A transcription of this interview can be seen in \autoref{appendix:trans-emil}.
