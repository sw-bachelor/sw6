\section{Pre sprint 1 conclusion}
In pre sprint 1 we defined user stories for the first sprint.
These were based on both the user stories received from the previous PO group, as well as the interview with Emil from Egebakken.
During the interview, Emil specified that he would like to see development resources focused on the weekplanner application, making it more stable and usable.
He was also of the opinion that offline functionality was important, and that documentation to assist in learning the application would be beneficial.

An overhaul of the prototypes provided by the previous PO group was necessary.
As we wanted to focus GIRAF 2019 on the front end of the application, the design was updated.
At the same time we wanted to make the prototypes more interactive and easier to give to the next generation of GIRAF developers.
These prototypes were continually updated as more functionality was defined for the project or other issues arose.
