\section{User stories prepared for sprint 1}
A major part of the work as the PO group is to define \texttt{user stories} to describe a feature and why it is wanted in the simple format of:
\\\\
As a (user type) I would like (feature) so that (reason).
\\\\
The development team should then be able to transform these user stories into technical requirements that they can distribute within their own group for implementation.
Based on the suggested sprints from the previous PO group and the interview with Emil, we defined a series of user stories with suggested features, which primarily focused on increasing usability and the user experience of the application.
They are named based on the repositories in which they can be found on the GIRAF GitHub site, along with a number to differentiate them.
\\\\
For the first sprint, the following user stories were included, in order of importance:

\begin{longtable}{|p{0.2\textwidth}|p{0.9\textwidth}|}

    Weekplanner\#6  & As a guardian I would like the user selection screen to look better so it makes it easier for me to find the correct user                                                                    \\ \hline
    Weekplanner\#7  & As a guardian I would like a better login screen so that the application is more appealing                                                                                                   \\ \hline
    Weekplanner\#8  & As a citizen I would like the ability to choose how my day is represented (horizontally or vertically) so that it fits my personal preference                                                \\ \hline
    Weekplanner\#9  & As a guardian, I would like that the app is fully available offline so that I can still use it if the internet is down                                                                       \\ \hline
    Weekplanner\#10 & As a citizen I would like to disable colors in the app so that it does not overstimulate me                                                                                                  \\ \hline
    Weekplanner\#11 & As a guardian, I would like a way to add pictograms directly from google so that I can quickly improvise if the system does not have the activity I want                                     \\ \hline
    Weekplanner\#12 & As a guardian, I would like to be able to copy the content of a plan in the weekplanner from one user to another so that I won't have to do it twice, if two citizens have the same schedule \\ \hline
    Weekplanner\#13 & As a guardian I would like guides available for the system so that it is easy to look up the features that I don't fully understand how to use                                               \\ \hline
    Weekplanner\#14 & As a citizen I would like the icons to be consistent throughout the system so that I instinctively know their meaning                                                                        \\ \hline
    Weekplanner\#15 & As a citizen I would like to be able to choose how many days I see at a time on my weekplanner, so that it fits my personal preference                                                       \\ \hline
    Weekplanner\#16 & As a guardian I would like to be able to see results as I'm typing the name of a pictogram so that I can see if there are any results instead of just seeing my keyboard                     \\ \hline
    Weekplanner\#17 & As a guardian I would like to confirm with a password that the system is changing to guardian mode so that a citizen cannot gain access to it                                                \\ \hline
    Weekplanner\#19 & As a user I would like the icons to be updated so that they are modern and easy to understand                                                                                                \\ \hline
