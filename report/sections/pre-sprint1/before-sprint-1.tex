\section{Prepared work from previous years}\label{prepared-work-from-previous-years}
Before the first semester wide sprint could start, our group had some work to do as preparation hereof.
First of all, during the readthrough of the reports from previous years, it was discovered that the PO group of 2018 had left us a suggestion for content in the first sprint.
The following resources were available to us upon the start of the project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item User stories for the first sprint
    \item Prototypes for the GIRAF application
    \item A design guide for the interface of the application
\end{itemize}
The previous year produced two releases in a sprint.
As such, user stories were prepared for two releases.
For our development process for all groups we only release once per sprint, so these user stories would be incorporated into only the first sprint.
They had also prepared prototypes to illustrate the vision of the project.
A design guide from 2015 detailing the foundation of design for GIRAF was also available. 

\subsubsection{Suggestion for the first release by the previous PO group}
The first release that the previous PO group suggests includes two user stories.
The first user story presents the need for a guardian to be able to mark multiple activities and perform actions on these activities at the same time.
\\\\
The second user story was about a user being able to change the way that an activity was marked as being completed.
This could, for example, be represented by a checkmark, by hiding the activity or by moving the activity a bit to the right on the schedule for the day.
These user stories are suggested for the first release because it should be easy for the developers during the start of the project, as they are not familiar with the codebase yet.

\subsubsection{Suggestion for the second release by the previous PO group}
For the second release, the previous PO group suggest another two user stories.
The first one is that a user should be able to time activities with a timer.
This is needed so the citizens know how much time their activities take.
The guardian should be able to add this timer with a specific duration and connect it to the activity, after which the citizen should then be the one that starts the timer.
\\\\
The second user story concerns a feature for guardians that allows them to choose between a set of visual representations for the timers that they can add to the activities.
This is needed because the citizens have different preferences when it comes to the representation of the time.
\\\\
Just as the first suggested release, this suggested release is meant to be light in workload to allow the developers to get familiar with the codebase, and to make sure that all groups can finish their tasks for the sprint.

\subsubsection{Design guide}
A design guide was available, made by an earlier GIRAF group.
However, this guide seemed to be last updated in 2015 and seemed to never have been properly used for implementation.
This design guide was located on a decentralized location, meaning not many of the developers were even aware of its existence.
It was also around 80 pages long, meaning it could be quite intimidating to search through and to follow.

\subsubsection{Prototypes}
A set of prototypes was constructed by the previous year.
The available prototypes were made by putting images into a PowerPoint presentation and making clickable areas to navigate through them.
This resulted in a single set of prototypes consisting of 122 slides, which could not be edited by other means than replacing a given element in every single slide, even for the slides with very little variation.


\subsubsection{Conclusion on the prepared work}
Two user stories for each release is not enough work for 7 groups. 
As previous years had dedicated backend, frontend and server groups, a user story often had to be split into tasks for multiple groups.
The user stories are not large enough to be given to multiple groups.
This year we decided to work in full stack groups, and because of this a group is able to take one or more user stories for each sprint and then only work on the assigned user stories.
GIRAF in 2019 will also be mostly focused on frontend development which the previous year was not.
The user stories that were prepared are still useful and they have been put into the backlog along with others, but they will not be the foundation of the starting sprint.
The design guide is not entirely up to date, not completely finished and too long to effectively use.
As such, it is not all that useful for the GIRAF project in 2019.
The prototypes made by the previous PO group are functional, but their design and usability could be improved.
