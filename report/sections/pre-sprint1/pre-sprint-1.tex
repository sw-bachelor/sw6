\chapter{Pre sprint 1}
Prior to sprint 1, the product owners have some preliminary tasks, such as interviewing customers and turning the results of this interview into user stories and preparing associated prototypes.
In this chapter, the interview with Emil, our initial user stories and the making of new prototypes will be covered.
In the previous year, prototypes were made in PowerPoint.
As it is very difficult to make changes in PowerPoint, we decided to increase the flexibility of the prototypes by re-creating them in Adobe XD, which is a software that is dedicated to the creation of prototypes.
