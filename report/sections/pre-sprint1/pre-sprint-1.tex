\chapter{Pre sprint 1}
Before sprint 1 the product owners have many tasks such as making user stories, interviewing customers and preparing prototypes.
In this chapter the interview with Emil, initial user stories and the making of new prototypes are covered.
Previous semesters made prototypes in powerpoint. It is very difficult to make changes in powerpoint, so to make it easier for ourselves we choose to make new prototypes in Adobe xd with inspiration from previous prototypes.
