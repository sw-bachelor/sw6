The Graphical Interface Resource for Autistic Folk (GIRAF)
 is an application suite designed to help institutions for citizens with autism spectrum disorder. 
 Its main functionality is to provide an easy way to schedule activities for a given week.
 It is a multi-project being built by sixth semester software engineering students at Aalborg University. \\
 This report focuses on the product owner aspect of the GIRAF project, with a focus on gathering information from customers, building prototypes, and usability testing. \\
 In addition to the responsibilites as a product owner, it will describe the processes used for the application.\\
 The process uses full stack development teams to facilitate cooperation between developers.
 The result is a functional version of the application, usable on both Android and iOS.
 According to the customers, it is an intuitive application compared to what they have previously tried.}
