The Graphical Interface Resource for Autistic Folk (GIRAF)
 is an application suite designed to help institutions for citizens with autism spectrum disorder. 
 It is a multi-project being built by sixth semester software engineering students at Aalborg University. \\
 This report focuses on the product owner aspect of the GIRAF project, with a focus on gathering information from customers, building prototypes, and usability testing. \\
 In addition to the responsibilites as a product owner, it will describe how we worked on the week planner application and changed the framework from Xamarin to Flutter.\\
 Unlike previous years, this year used full stack development teams, rather than having dedicated frontend, backend and server groups.
 The result of this semesters work was a somewhat functional verison of the application, which is functional on both Android and iOS, and according to the customers, it was a very intuitive application compared to what they have previously tried.}
