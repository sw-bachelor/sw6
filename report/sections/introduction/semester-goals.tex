\section{Product vision}\label{sec:introduction-product-vision}
Based on the state of the GIRAF project and our communication with the customers we defined some goals for the project that we wanted to realize this semester.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Make the weekplanner application stable and intuitive
    \item Make the weekplanner application available on iOS
    \item Make the weekplanner application fully available when offline
    \item Make it easily accessible for next year's GIRAF students
\end{itemize}
It was important for the customers that they would get something stable and intuitive, and as such extra functionality was not necessary for them.
Stability is really important for people with autism as they do not react well to unforeseen changes.
Based on this we chose to solely focus on the weekplanner application.

Another goal was to make the application available for iOS devices, as many of the citizens used iPads.
Furthermore, the customers wanted the application to still function without an internet connection.
Lastly, we wanted to make it easier and more accessible for the next year's students to get started with the GIRAF project.
