\section{Scrum of Scrums}
Scrum is a framework that is used extensively in software projects.
Its an agile approach to working with complex and changing problems where a normal waterfall model does not work optimally.
In this project we used Scrum of Scrums (SoS) to structure the groups across the whole GIRAF team.
SoS is a modification of Scrum made to scale it better for bigger teams.
Many of the activities are similar to normal Scrum.
The sprint process of SoS works in the following way:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sprint Planning
    \item SoS Stand Up
    \item Skill Group Meetings
    \item Release Preparation
    \item Sprint Review
    \item Sprint Retrospective
    \item Release Party
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sprint Planning}
Sprint planning is a meeting on the first day of a new sprint where all groups are expected to show.

Prior to the meeting the PO-group has made user stories based on communication with the customers.
The user stories will have prototypes, a definition of what is needed based of the view of a user and a technical description of what is expected to be coded.

The PO-group has also made relevant and realistic goals for the oncoming sprint, which should translate into a new release of the GIRAF software for the app store.
It is important that the goals are reachable to give the groups a sense of accomplishment.
This has been an issue in earlier years were groups did not feel that there was a clear improvement in the software which drastically reduced moral.

The meeting starts by the PO-group presenting, or refreshing, the goals they chose for the whole semester and then more specifically the goals they want fulfilled in the oncoming sprint.
Afterwards the groups will look at the user stories that is in the the backlog and ask clarifying question if needed.

The groups then choose a user story from the highest prioritized user stories.
Before the groups can begin working they have to get their choice approved by the PO-group.
When all the groups have been approved the sprint planning is over and development can begin.

\subsection{SoS Stand Up}
During a normal sprint week there will be at least one SoS Stand Up meeting.
All groups should send at least one person to these meetings but if necessary more can attend, though the goal should be to send as few as possible.
A Stand Up meeting takes at most 15 minutes, when 15 minutes has past the meeting ends no matter what.

During the meeting each group should present what they have, and are, working on and what they will work on until the next meeting.
They should also notify the others of what problems they had faced or are facing and if they are about to introduce something new that could affect other groups.
Each group representative takes turn to present, if there is time afterwards people may ask questions to the other groups else they have to talk after the meeting.


\subsection{Skill Group Meetings}
Previous years the responsibility of the project was spread out across the groups.
Most groups had one area of responsibility, these were frontend, backend and server.
One group also worked as product owners and one as scrum masters beside their normal responsibility area.
This spread of responsibility seemed to have been inefficent and caused the groups to feel less responsibility for the project as a whole.

Therefore we were advised to split into skill groups, where each group has atleast one specialist in each of the responsibility areas.
This in theory should give all groups a sense of responsibility for the project as a whole.

All the specialist in the same area then get into groups which are called skill groups so that decisions and experience could be shared across all the regular groups in the project.
The skill groups decide for themselves when they choose to have meetings, but usually they meet once a week or more if there are certain difficulties that needs to be fixed.
The skill groups are in the end responsible for the decision making regarding their area, such as which framework to use or how the code should be standarized.

\subsection{Release Preparation}
As the sprint comes to an end the sprint goals should hopefully have been completed.
This means a lot of new features has been made which need to be added to the release version of the program.

Four days before the sprint ends the PO-group opens a release branch.
This branch is for all the features which the PO-group has accepted as finished and all the groups are responsible for that their own code functions properly with all the rest of the newly added features.


\subsection{Sprint Review}

The sprint review is a meeting at the end of a sprint. 
Each group should be represented by one of the group members. 
It can be a advantage to have multiple members of the PO-group present if questions about some of the features that have been developed should arise.

Each group presents the current state of their work, gives feedback on the quality of the product aswell as comes with new issues that may have arised which could be included in the next sprint.
After all the groups have presented there is an open discussion about the projects state and the differend groups work.

\subsection{Sprint Retrospective}

The sprint Retrospective is a big meeting usually held right after the sprint review.
All members of all groups should participate in this meeting.
The goal of the sprint Retrospective is to have a discussion about the process of the sprint, what was good, what was bad, new ideas etc.
All participants are split out into discussion groups were each development group should have atleast one representative.
Each discussion group then talks about their experiences doing the sprint and comes up with feedback and new ideas that should could be implemnted into SoS.
All the topics that are being discussed in the discussion groups are noted and a list of proposals for things that should change for the next sprint is compiled.
Each attendee has three votes that can be used to vote for what they think are good proposals.

Afterwards the scrum group will take the most voted for proposals and decide if some version of these should be incorporated into the new sprint.

\subsection{Release Party}

The release party is an optianal social gathering celebrating the new release. 
This is a change for the development groups to socialize with eachother and pride themselves with making a new release.
