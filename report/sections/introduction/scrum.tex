\section{Scrum of Scrums}
Scrum is a framework that is used extensively in software projects.
Its an agile approach to working with complex and changing problems where a normal waterfall model does not work optimally.
Scrum of Scrums (SoS) is a modification of Scrum to scale it better for bigger teams.
Many of the activities are similar to normal Scrum.
The sprint process of SoS works in the following way:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sprint Planning
    \item SoS Stand Up
    \item Skill Group Meetings
    \item Release Preparation
    \item Sprint Review
    \item Sprint Retrospective
    \item Release Party
\end{itemize}
