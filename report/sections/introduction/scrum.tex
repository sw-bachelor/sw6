\section{Scrum of Scrums}
Scrum is a framework that is used extensively in software projects.
Its an agile approach to working with complex and changing problems where a normal waterfall model does not work optimally.
In this project we used Scrum of Scrums (SoS) to structure the groups across the whole Giraf team.
SoS is a modification of Scrum made to scale it better for bigger teams.
Many of the activities are similar to normal Scrum.
The sprint process of SoS works in the following way:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sprint Planning
    \item SoS Stand Up
    \item Skill Group Meetings
    \item Release Preparation
    \item Sprint Review
    \item Sprint Retrospective
    \item Release Party
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sprint Planning}
Sprint planning is a meeting on the first day of a new sprint where all groups are expected to show.

Prior to the meeting the PO-group has made user stories based on communication with the customers.
The user stories will have prototypes, a definition of what is needed based of the view of a user and a technical description of what is expected to be coded.

The PO-group has also made relevant and realistic goals for the oncoming sprint, which should translate into a new release of the giraf software for the app store.
It is important that the goals are reachable to give the groups a sense of accomplishment.
This has been an issue in earlier years were groups did not feel that there was a clear improvement in the software which drasticly reduced moral.

The meeting starts by the PO-group presenting, or refreshing, the goals they chose for the whole semester and then more specificly the goals they want forfilled in the oncoming sprint.
Afterwards the groups will look at the user stories that is in the the backlog and ask clarifing question if needed.

The groups then choose a user story from the highest protitized user stories.
Before the groups can begin working they have to get their choice approved ny the PO-group.
When all the groups have been approved the sprint planning is over and development can begin.
