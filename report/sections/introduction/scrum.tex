\subsection{Scrum of Scrums}
The previous semesters suggest that Scrum of Scrums is used as a project management process. Scrum of scrums is used to scale scrum …………………

\subsection{Semester roles}
Different from previous semesters, this semester the groups are fullstack teams. This means that all groups have responsibility in frontend, backend and servers.
Previous semesters there had been a frontend - , backend -, server -, scrum master - and product owner group. 
According to the previous semesters, this had not worked optimally, and they recommended that the groups became fullstack teams.
Even though that they are fullstack teams, it has been decided that there will still be a scrum master - and product owner group. 
The fullstack groups will get user stories to implement at every sprint.

\subsection{Competence groups}
In every fullstack group there are people with different responsibilities.
There are an accountable person for frontend, backend and server.
The people with the responsibility with one of these areas will have meetings with the accountable from the other groups to share knowledge and discuss problems that have been encountered.
These groups are called competence groups.
Competence groups are suggested to have at least one weekly meeting.
