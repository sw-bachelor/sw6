\section{The GIRAF process}\label{the-giraf-process}
As mentioned in \autoref{sec:scrum_terms}, this project uses a process loosely based on Scrum. Scrum is a framework that is used extensively in software development projects.
It is an agile approach to working with complex and changing problems where a normal waterfall model does not work optimally.
\\\\
The process used originally was \textit{Scrum of Scrums}, which was already a modified version of Scrum,but the process group ended up modifying it even further to better fit our workflow.
The sprint structure for our process contained the following elements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sprint introduction
    \item Stand up meetings
    \item Skill group meetings
    \item Release preparation
    \item Release party
    \item Sprint retrospective
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sprint planning} \label{subsec:sprint-planning}
Initially the GIRAF project used sprint planning, but later changed to use sprint introduction instead.
Sprint introduction will be described in the next section.
\\
\\
Sprint planning was the first meeting in a new sprint where each group should have made a prioritized list of the user stories they would want to work with.
Prior to the meeting, we had created user stories based on communication with the customers.
The user stories included prototypes, a definition of what was needed based on the view of a user and a technical description of what was expected.
\\
\\
We also made relevant and realistic goals for the sprint, which should translate into a new release of the GIRAF application.
It was important that the goals were reachable to give the participating groups a sense of accomplishment.
This had been an issue in earlier years of the GIRAF project, where groups did not feel that there was a clear improvement in the application which drastically reduced morale.
\\
\\
The meeting started with us presenting, or refreshing, the goals we had set for the whole semester and the goals we wanted to have fulfilled in the oncoming sprint.
Afterwards, the groups took a look at the user stories that were in the the backlog and asked clarifying questions if needed.
\\
\\
The user stories were distributed among the groups as fairly as possible such that each group had one user story.
Each group then tried to approximate the time required to solve the user story and whether or not it should be split into smaller user stories.


\subsection{Sprint introduction} \label{subsec:sprint-introduction}
Sprint introduction was a modified version of the sprint planning meeting.
The meeting started with a presentation from us where we presented the project vision, the sprint vision and the user stories we wanted implemented throughout the sprint.
The user stories that we presented were chosen based on feedback from the customer and what we deemed was most essential for the application at the current time.
\\
\\
After the meeting, the groups chose a user story from the presented user stories in a first come, first served manner.
Before the groups could begin working, they had to get their choice approved by us, in order to establish an overview and prevent multiple groups from working on the same user story.

\subsection{Stand up}
During a normal sprint week there would be one or two stand up meetings.
All groups sent one person to these meetings, but if necessary more could attend.
A stand up meeting took at most 15 minutes.
When 15 minutes had passed, the meeting ended no matter what.
\\
\\
During the meetings each group presented what they had worked on, were working on, and what they would be working on until the next meeting.
They also notified the others of problems they had faced or were facing, and if they were about to introduce something new that could affect other groups.
Each group representative presented in turns. 
If time allowed, people could ask the other groups questions.

\subsection{Skill group meetings}
During previous years the responsibility of the project was spread out across the groups.
Most groups had one specific area of responsibility.
These were front end, backend and server.
One group also had the responsibility of being PO and one focused on the processes besides their normal area of responsibility.
This spread of responsibility seemed to be inefficient and caused the groups to feel less responsibility for the project as a whole.
\\\\
In this semester we used full stack groups instead, where all groups were responsible for front end, back end and server.
Every group had one specialist in each of the areas of responsibility.
This, in theory, should give all groups a sense of responsibility for the project as a whole.
All the specialists of the same area became members of skill groups, so that decisions and experience could be shared across all the regular groups in the project.
The skill groups decided for themselves when they chose to have meetings, but usually they met once a week or more if there were certain difficulties that needed to be addressed.
The skill groups were ultimately responsible for the decision making regarding their area, such as which framework to use or how the code should be standardized.

\subsection{Release preparation}
As each sprint came to an end a new release version of the application was created.
Two working days before the sprint ended we opened a release branch.
This branch was for all the features which we accepted.
All groups were assigned to review user stories that had been implemented throughout the finished sprint and creating issues if they found any bugs or anything that was lackluster.
The group that implemented the user story originally was then responsible for fixing these issues.

\subsection{Release party}
The release party was an optional social gathering celebrating the new release. 
The state of the application was presented so that everyone could see what had been accomplished throughout the sprint.
This was a chance for all the groups to socialize with each other and feel a sense of pride due to the new release.

\subsection{Sprint retrospective}
The sprint retrospective was usually held the first working day after the release party.
Every member of all of the groups should participate in this meeting.
The goal of the sprint retrospective was to have a discussion about the process of the sprint.
All participants were split into discussion groups where all development groups on the project should be represented.
\\\\
Each discussion group talked about their experiences during the sprint and gave feedback and new ideas that could be implemented into the process.
All the topics that were discussed in the discussion groups were noted, and a list of proposals for things that should change for the next sprint was compiled.
Afterwards, the process group created a questionnaire with all of the feedback, and everyone in the GIRAF project had the chance to answer whether or not they agreed with the points that were raised in the discussion groups.
