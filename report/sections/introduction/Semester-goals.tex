\section{Product vision}
Based on state of the GIRAF project and our communication with the customers we, the PO-group, decided some goals for the project that we wanted fulfilled this semester.
The customers biggest wish was to just get something that they could actually use.
Some of them have been in this project for 7 years now without getting a proper working version.
It was important for them that they would get something stable and useful, extra functionality was not necessary.
Stability is really important as people who have autism does not react well to unforeseen changes, so a program crash can cause a massive problem for the citizen.

Based on this we chose to focus on the weekplaner.
Our main goal is to get that app as stable as possible and give it a revamp on the design front so that it is more intuitive with for the users.

Another goal is to get the app running on iOS devices as many of the citizens that would be using this app are using iPads.

Furthermore we would like the app to still function when connection to the internet disappears as this again would be an unforeseen change that could upset a citizen.

Last but not least we would like to make it easier and more accessible for the next year students to get started with the GIRAF project.
Hopefully drastically reducing the time they need to get up to speed before they can start making contributions which has been a problem not only this year but earlier years as well.
