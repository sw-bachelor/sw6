\section{Semester roles}\label{sec:semesterRoles}
Although all developers decided to have full stack teams, it was decided that there should still be a dedicated process group and a product owner group. 

\subsection{Process group}
The process group was responsible for facilitating the work process across all the other groups.
They arranged meetings and tried to optimize the meetings to avoid wasting time.
\\
There were some well defined tasks for the process group which were:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Decide process changes during the semester
    \item Plan meetings in accordance with the process
    \item Plan the first skill group meetings
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Product owner group}
Our role this semester was to function as product owners of the GIRAF project. 
As product owners, we strove to have interviews with the customers at the end of every sprint to get feedback and conduct usability tests on the product.
The primary goal for our group was to maximize the value of the application for the customers. 
This was done by prioritizing user stories so that the customers got as much value as possible \autocite{TheScrumGuide}.\\
\\
There were some well defined tasks for the product owner group, which were:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Interview customers
    \item Create user stories    
    \item Refine the backlog regularly and prioritize user stories
    \item Create prototypes
    \item Create a sprint vision and sprint goals
    \item Ensure that the development teams understand the user stories
    \item Approve or decline features made by the development teams
    \item Conduct usability tests
\end{itemize}
