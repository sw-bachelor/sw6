\section{Semester roles}
The groups for this semester acted as full stack teams, which was different from previous semesters. 
This meant that all of the groups had responsibilities related to frontend, backend and servers.
Previous years saw groups specializing in certain areas, so there was a frontend -, backend -, server -, scrum master - and product owner group. 
According to the previous years, this had not worked optimally, and they recommended that the groups became full stack teams to ensure all groups had knowledge in all areas.
Even though we decided to be full stack teams, we also decided that there should still be a dedicated process group and a product owner group. 
Every full stack group received user stories to implement in every sprint.

\subsection{Process Group}
The process group was responsible for facilitating the work process across all the other groups.
They arranged meetings and tried to optimize the meetings to avoid wasting time.
\\
There were some well defined tasks for the process group which were:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Deciding process changes during the semester
    \item Host the sprint planning meetings
    \item Facilitate stand up meetings for all groups
    \item Plan the first skill group meetings
    \item Host the sprint retrospective meetings
\end{itemize}
\noindent
The process group decided the initial processes for this semester based on feedback and discussions with all GIRAF members.
During the semester they evaluated the process model to investigate if the process worked as optimally as possible.
\\
15 minutes were allocated for stand up meetings, and it was the responsibility of the process group that they did not go over time.

\subsection{Product Owner Group}
Our role this semester was to function as product owners of the GIRAF project and to be in charge of customer contact. 
As product owners, we strove to have interviews with the customers at the end of every sprint to get feedback and conduct usability tests on the product.
The primary goal for our group was to maximize the value of the application for the customers. 
This was done by prioritizing user stories so that the customers got as much value as possible \autocite{TheScrumGuide}.\\
\\
There were some well defined tasks for the product owner group, which were:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Interview customers
    \item Create user stories    
    \item Refine the backlog regularly and prioritize user stories
    \item Create prototypes
    \item Create a sprint vision and sprint goals
    \item Ensure that the development teams understand the user stories
    \item Approve or decline features made by the development teams
    \item Conduct usability tests
\end{itemize}
\noindent
The interviews are the foundation for understanding the requirements of the program and are used to create user stories. 
Prototypes are created from the user stories.
These prototypes are used to create an initial design for the new features that the user stories might include. 
This is done so that we can have a visual presentation of the user stories which makes it easier for us to communicate with the customer and make sure that we understand each other. 
This way we can get a confirmation that the design ideas we have been working on satisfy the needs of the customer.
When the prototypes are approved by the customer they are added to the user stories in the backlog, so that the development teams can use them as a frame of reference when implementing them.
\\\\
At the start of every sprint we define a vision for the sprint, define sprint goals and update the backlog to deliver value. 
The vision and sprint goal are made to ensure that every team knows what they are working towards, and to motivate them to deliver a good product.
When a sprint ends, a usability test is conducted on the newest release to test new features and to get feedback in order to determine what should be developed next, and whether or not the new functionality is acceptable.
