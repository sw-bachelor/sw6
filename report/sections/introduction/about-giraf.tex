\section{About GIRAF}
GIRAF (Graphical Interface Resource for Autistic Folk) is an ongoing project developed by 6th semester software engineering students at Aalborg University. 
The project has been continuously in development since 2011 with Ulrik Mathias Nyman as project coordinator, with the new students assuming responsibility and learning to cooperate in a bigger environment with an existing codebase. 
\\\\
GIRAF is an application that serves the purpose of helping people with autism, with the primary user group being children.
The primary goal of the application is to provide visual representation of the daily or weekly schedule for the users.
During the lifetime of the project, different types of games and communication tools to help with education have been implemented, but most of these functionalities do not work after the API rework of 2017.
\\\\
A special aspect of the project is the direct interaction with customers, who are essential for the project.
The customers serve to define the requirements of the application and facilitate the familiarization of students with industry processes.
\\

Currently the institutions that are represented are: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mette and Emil, Egebakken (School)
    \item Kristine and Susanne, Birken (Kindergarten)
\end{itemize}
