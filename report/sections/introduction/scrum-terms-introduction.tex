\section{Introduction to scrum terms}\label{sec:scrum_terms}
In this project we used a process loosely based on scrum.
Because of this, we introduce some of the terms from scrum that are used in the report in this section.

\subsubsection{Product owner}
The product owner role is the role accountable for maximizing the value of a product for the customers.
This is generally done through incremental management of the backlog and by defining expectations with the customer that are then communicated to the development team.

\subsubsection{Product Backlog}
Development work is categorized as issues or user stories in a backlog.
The product backlog is the term used when concerned with issues and user stories for the whole project.
All tasks that must be implemented are initially in the product backlog. 

\subsubsection{Sprint backlog}
The sprint backlog is the backlog that concerns itself with only the necessary functionality for a sprint.
Issues and stories from the product backlog are dragged into this sprint backlog to define what should be accomplished in the sprint.
