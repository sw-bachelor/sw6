\section{Our role}
This semester our role is to function as product owner and be in contact with the customers.
As product owners we strive to have interviews with customers at every sprint to get feedback and conduct usability tests on the product. 
The goal for us as product owners is to maximaize the value for the customers by prioritising the user stories, so that the customers will get early value.

\\
There are some well defined tasks for the product owner group, which are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Interview customers
    \item Create user stories    
    \item Refine backlog regularly and prioritise user stories
    \item Create prototypes
    \item Create sprint vision and sprint goals
    \item Ensure that the development teams understand the user stories
    \item Approve or decline features made by the development teams
    \item Conduct usability tests
\end{itemize}
\noindent
The interviews are used to create user stories. 
From user stories prototypes are created, which are later shown to the customers.
When the prototypes are approved they are added to the user stories in the backlog.
\\
At every sprint we make a vision for the sprint, sprint goals and update the backlog. 
The vision and sprint goal is made to ensure that every team knows what they are working towards.
When a sprints ends a usability test is conducted on the newest release to test new features and to get feedback.
