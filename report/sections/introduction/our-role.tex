\section{Our role}
This semester our role is to function as product owner of the scrum team and be in contact with the customers.
As product owners we strive to have interviews with customers at every sprint to get feedback and conduct usability tests on the product. 
The goal for product owners is to maximize the value for the customers by prioritising the user stories, so that the customers will get as much value as early as possible \autocite{TheScrumGuide}.\\
\\
There are some well defined tasks for the product owner group, which are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Interview customers
    \item Create user stories    
    \item Refine backlog regularly and prioritise user stories
    \item Create prototypes
    \item Create sprint vision and sprint goals
    \item Ensure that the development teams understand the user stories
    \item Approve or decline features made by the development teams
    \item Conduct usability tests
\end{itemize}
\noindent
The interviews are the foundation for understand the requirements of the program and are used to create user stories. 
From user stories prototypes are created.
These prototypes are based on the user stories so as to have clearly defined goals, meaning the feedback is relevant for that particular user story.
The prototypes are later shown to the customers for usability testing and to confirm which direction in which direction the development should continue.
When the prototypes are approved they are added to the user stories in the backlog, so that the development teams can use them as a frame of reference when implementing them.
\\\\
At every sprint we make a vision for the sprint, define sprint goals and update the backlog to deliver value. 
The vision and sprint goal are made to ensure that every team knows what they are working towards, and to motivate them to deliver a good product.
When a sprint ends a usability test is conducted on the newest release to test new features and to get feedback and determine what should be worked on next.
