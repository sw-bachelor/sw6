\section{From interview to product}
In this section the process of how we constructed user stories and prototypes is explained.
\\
We started off by having an interview with the customers and based off of this created user stories detailing the features the customers needed.
When a user story had been created the process of making the appropriate prototypes could be started.
We start with a prototype from one of the main screens like the week plan screen.
From there through multiple prototypes we show the actions, that we consider to be the most intuitive, to access and use this new feature described by the user story.
When these prototypes had been approved by multiple members from our group we would collect them in a document to show to the customers.
\\
Doing the next meeting with the customers we would then present the new prototypes and get feedback.
Based on the customers feedback we would edit and add the prototypes to the corresponding user stories.
