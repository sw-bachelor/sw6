\chapter{Introduction}
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a condition that is characterized by a broad range of challenges within different areas such as social skills, speech and nonverbal communication, or by causing repetitive behavior.
In 2014 there were 16.8 occurrences of the ASD diagnosis per 1,000 children, and approximately 1\% of all Danes have an ASD diagnosis\autocite{cdcdata}. 
As ASD is a spectrum disorder, each person diagnosed with it has different strengths and challenges.
This results in people with ASD learning, thinking and solving problems very differently, with ranges from highly skilled and functional to severely challenged. 
Some may require support in their daily lives while others on the spectrum can live entirely independently\autocite{autismspeaks}.
