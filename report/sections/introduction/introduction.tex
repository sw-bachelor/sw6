\chapter{Introduction}
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a condition that is characterized by a broad range of challenges within different areas such as social skills, speech, repetitive behavior and nonverbal communication.
In 2014 there were 16.8 occurences of the ASD diagnosis per 1,000, and around 1\% of all danes have an ASD diagnose\autocite{cdcdata}. 
As ASD is a spectrum disorder, each person with autism has different strengths and challenges.
This results in people with autism learning, thinking and solving problems very differently, with ranges from highly skilled to severely challenged. 
Some may require support in their daily lives while others on the spectrum can live entirely independently\autocite{autismspeaks}.
