\todo{ref til state of GIRAF May 2019}

In addition to these chapters, we suggest that you take a look at the \href{https://github.com/aau-giraf/wiki}{GIRAF wiki}.
This repository contains most of the available information about the GIRAF project, including guides for the new PO and process groups.

In the wiki, you will also find a lot of information that is not available in this report, such as the design guide, which explains the design choices that previous PO groups have made in collaboration with the customers.
In addition to this, you will also find information about the weekplanner application, server administration and an overview of the repositories in the GIRAF project.

Good luck, and enjoy your time working on the GIRAF project!
