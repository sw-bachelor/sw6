\section{Sprint retrospective}\label{sec:sprint-4-retrospective}
This sprint retrospective was like the sprint 3 retrospective described in \autoref{sprint-3-retrospective}.
The only difference was that the process group did not choose areas in which we needed to focus, as this was the final sprint.
They noted the amount of people who agree, do not care or disagree with each suggestion, followed by their comments on it.
In this retrospective, a lot of the comments were directed at the the PO group, and many of them were met with different opinions by the other groups. 
For this reason we will be bringing these points up in the discussion \autoref{sec:retrospective-discussion} instead.
