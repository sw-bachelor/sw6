\section{Sprint review}
Just as in sprint 3, we did not have an official sprint review for this sprint, but we still evaluated what had been completed during the sprint internally in the PO group.
For this sprint, as mentioned in the introduction in \autoref{sec:sprint-4-introduction}, we delegated the user stories to the different groups to make sure that the most necessary stories would be completed. There were also some leftover user stories from sprint 3 that the development groups had to finish.

The user stories for sprint 4 and their status can be seen on \autoref{table:sprint-4-review}.

\end{longtable}

As can be seen on \autoref{table:sprint-4-review}, all of the user stories were completed. Furthermore, it shoud be mentioned that for each \texttt{web-api} issue completed that introduced a new endpoint, there was also an equivalent endpoint made in the \texttt{api-client} to allow communication between the backend and the frontend.
