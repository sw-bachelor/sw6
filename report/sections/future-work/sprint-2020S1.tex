\section{Sprint 2020S1}
For the first sprint in 2020, we suggest focusing on the following user stories:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Weekplanner\#15 As a guardian I would like to be able to choose how many days a citizen can see at a time on their weekplanner, so that it fits their personal preference 
    \item Weekplanner\#177 As a guardian I would like the week plans on "v√¶lg ugeplan" screen to show the week and year of each plan so that I can easily find the right plan 
    \item Weekplanner\#200 As a guardian I would like for the week plans to be sorted consistently every time I look at the week plans for a specific citizen
    \item Weekplanner\#202 As a guardian I would like to be able to edit week plan details (name, picture) so that I can fix mistakes I made
    \item Weekplanner\#233 Week names split into multiple lines if the display resolution is not high enough 
    \item Weekplanner\#264 As a citizen I would like a ding sound to play when my timer is completed so that I can hear that I'm done with my activity
\end{itemize}
\noindent
All of the mentioned user stories are either prioritized as high or highest. 
They are considered for the first sprint both because they are important features to have implemented, but also because they are the easier tasks to get started on.
These tasks require an understanding of the GIRAF project, but are good first issues to get started with the code base.
