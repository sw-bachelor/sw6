\chapter{Future work}
This chapter introduces the future work suggestions we have for GIRAF 2020. 
It presents suggested upcoming features, where we explain why some features are either highest or high priority tasks.
From these tasks we have created suggested sprint for 2020S1.
We consider these tasks for good first issues.
Lastly there are PO specific tasks that the PO group for 2020 should do.
