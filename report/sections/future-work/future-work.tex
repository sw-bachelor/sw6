\chapter{Future work}
This chapter introduces our suggestions for future work for GIRAF 2020. 
It presents suggested upcoming features, and explains why some features are respectively classified as high or highest priority.
From these tasks we have suggested a sprint for the first sprint of 2020, with tasks that we deem to be good first issues, to get started with the GIRAF project and Flutter.
Finally, there are some PO specific tasks that the PO group for 2020 should focus on.
