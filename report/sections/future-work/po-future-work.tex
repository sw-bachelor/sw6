\section{Future work for PO}
There are multiple tasks for PO to get started with as a PO group.
The new PO group should expect to have a heavy workload in the beginning of the semester because they have to gain an understanding of the status of the project, and what is required from the customers.
The PO specific tasks are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Create prototypes for the following user stories on GitHub:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Weekplanner\#13 As a guardian I would like guides available for the system so that it is easy to look up the features that I don't fully understand how to use
        \item Weekplanner\#265 As a guardian I would like an error message to be shown if I try to log in while I'm offline so that I know that I'm offline
        \item Weekplanner\#266 As a guardian I would like to be able to add a text to a pictogram in a week plan so that other guardians know what I mean by it
        \item Weekplanner\#267 As a citizen I would like to have text shown under my pictograms that describes what it is supposed to be so that I can learn to combine words with pictures 
        \item Weekplanner\#270 As a citizen I would like an indicator on my week plan to show that an activity has a timer so that I know it beforehand
        \item Weekplanner\#273 As a guardian I would like to be able to delete pictograms I've uploaded so that I can remove wrongly uploaded / outdated pictograms 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Create icons for:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Log In
        \item Not synced
        \item Synced
    \end{itemize}
    \item Schedule meetings with customers for interviews, usability tests and feedback on prototypes
    \item Read PO advice for 2020. Can be found in \autoref{appendix:PO-advice}
\end{itemize}
\noindent
We strongly suggest to the next PO group that they create the missing prototypes in Adobe XD.
Our prototypes documents can be found in the \href{https://github.com/aau-giraf/wiki/tree/master/design_guide/prototypes}{GIRAF wiki}. 
Here the next PO group will also easily be able to change the prototypes made this year.
Keep in mind, that all these prototypes have been approved by the customers, and if they wanted changes, we have made these changes.

For the icons there are only three missing. They can also be found in the \href{https://github.com/aau-giraf/wiki/blob/master/design_guide/icons.md}{GIRAF design guide}.

It is also required of them to schedule meetings with the customers.
From our experience it is recommended that you call the customers and send emails. 
If you only send emails, it is very likely that you will not get response from many of the customers. 
If you call them and they are not available, they usually call back.
